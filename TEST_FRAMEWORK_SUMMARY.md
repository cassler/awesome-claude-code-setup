# Test Framework Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Issue #13: Test Framework Foundation
- Installed BATS (Bash Automated Testing System)
- Created `tests/setup-tests.sh` for easy BATS installation
- Set up test directory structure (unit/integration/fixtures)
- Created comprehensive test documentation in `tests/README.md`

### Issues #3 & #27: Test Helper Implementation
- Created `scripts/test-helper.sh` with smart test operations:
  - `find-for` - Find tests for any source file
  - `coverage-gaps` - Identify untested files
  - `related-to-changes` - Run tests for git changes
  - `create-skeleton` - Generate test templates
  - `detect-runner` - Auto-detect test framework
- Added test-helper to main claude-helper.sh entry point
- Supports multiple languages and test frameworks

### Issue #14: Modernization Helper
- Created `scripts/modernize-bash.sh` to identify old syntax
- Found 399 instances of `[` that could be modernized to `[[`
- Provides guidance on common replacements

### First Unit Test
- Created `tests/unit/common-functions.bats`
- Comprehensive tests for all functions in common-functions.sh
- All 16 tests passing

## Remaining Tasks ðŸ“‹

### Issue #14: Complete Bash Modernization
- 399 instances of old-style `[` syntax need updating
- Scripts with most instances:
  - project-info.sh (123)
  - test-helper.sh (36)
  - ts-helper.sh (33)
  - env-check.sh (24)
  - api-helper.sh (21)

### Additional Test Coverage
- 20 scripts still need test files
- Priority targets:
  - git-ops.sh (core functionality)
  - search-tools.sh (frequently used)
  - project-info.sh (main entry point)

### CI/CD Integration
- Add GitHub Actions workflow to run tests
- Run tests on pull requests
- Generate coverage reports

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Install test framework
./tests/setup-tests.sh

# Run all tests
bats tests/unit/*.bats

# Find tests for a file
ch test find-for scripts/common-functions.sh

# Find untested files
ch test coverage-gaps scripts/

# Run tests for changed files
ch test related-to-changes

# Create test skeleton
ch test create-skeleton scripts/git-ops.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. Use modernize-bash.sh to systematically update syntax in each script
2. Write tests for core scripts (git-ops, search-tools, project-info)
3. Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
4. Document testing best practices in CONTRIBUTING.md
