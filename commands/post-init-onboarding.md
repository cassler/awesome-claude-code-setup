# Post-Init Onboarding & Setup

Complete the onboarding process for this codebase:

## 1. Environment Setup

- **Verify .env configuration**
  - Check all required API keys are present
  - Validate environment-specific settings
  - Ensure secrets are properly protected

- **Test service connectivity**
  ```bash
  make dev        # Start all services
  make test       # Run health checks
  ```

## 2. Run Setup Scripts

- **Database initialization**
  - Check if schemas are properly applied
  - Verify initial data is loaded
  - Test database connections

- **Import initial data**
  ```bash
  # Run any data import or setup scripts found in the project
  # Examples: ./scripts/setup.sh, npm run setup, make init
  ```

## 3. Verify Core Functionality

- **Access all services**
  - Check README or documentation for service URLs
  - Verify each service is accessible
  - Test authentication if required

- **Test key workflows**
  - Execute main functionality
  - Verify data flows correctly
  - Check monitoring/logging systems

## 4. Q&A Session

Answer these questions to ensure understanding:

1. **Architecture Questions**
   - How do services communicate?
   - What's the main data flow through the system?
   - Where are key resources stored and managed?

2. **Development Questions**
   - What's the typical development workflow?
   - How do you extend core functionality?
   - Where do you add new API endpoints or features?

3. **Deployment Questions**
   - How does CI/CD work?
   - What's different in production config?
   - How are secrets managed?

## 5. Quick Wins

Identify and implement 2-3 quick improvements:
- Fix any setup issues discovered
- Add missing documentation
- Improve developer experience
- Clean up any warnings or errors

## 6. Create Personal Notes

Document:
- Your development environment setup
- Any gotchas or workarounds needed
- Useful commands or shortcuts discovered
- Questions for the team

This onboarding ensures you're fully set up and understand the codebase before diving into feature work!
